The word "Miruken" is Japanese.  It means a view of a view.  It suggests composition.

Miruken is an application framework that embraces composition and convention to enhance the javascript development stack.

Inversion of Control is the principle that separates a framework from an api.  JavaScript historically does not leverage object oriented principals. This often results in unnecessary and undesirable coupling and complexity.  Miruken leverages Inversion of Control and the dynamic capabilities of javascript to fill this missing layer and amplify the object oriented capabilites of JavaScript.
