The word **Miruken** is Japanese. It means a view of a view. It suggests composition.

Miruken is an application framework that embraces composition and convention to enhance the JavaScript development stack.

**Inversion of Control** is the principle that separates a framework from an API. JavaScript historically does not leverage object-oriented principles. This often results in unnecessary and undesirable coupling and complexity. Miruken leverages inversion of control and the dynamic capabilities of JavaScript to fill this missing layer and amplify the object-oriented capabilites of JavaScript.

Miruken focuses on the challenges surrounding **models** and **controllers**. It does all the heavy lifting for object inheritance, properties, mapping, validation, and error handling. Other frameworks like AngularJS have the **view** covered. Miruken is a framework that embraces true object-oriented JavaScript. It focuses on convention, composition, and aspect-oriented programming.
