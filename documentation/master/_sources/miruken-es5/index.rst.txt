ES5

.. image:: img/miruken_circle_es5.png

Miruken-ES5 is the ECMAScript 5 implementation of the Miruken specification.
It should be obvious by the name, but just to be clear it does not use any of
the new ES2015 syntax and does not need to be transpiled with Babel. 
It is currently running in production on IE10, IE11, and Chrome.
