============================
Where Can I Get Miruken-ES5?
============================

It may be obvious by the name, but Miruken-ES5 packages do not use any or
the new ES2015 syntax and do not need to be transpiled.

Bower
=====

.. code-block:: js

    bower install miruken-es5

Brings in just the miruken library.

.. code-block:: js

    bower install miruken-es5-angular

Brings in the miruken library and the angular integration.

NPM
===
We do plan to publish miruken-es5 packages to npm but have not done so yet.
If you need these for your project please ask and we will move it up in
priority.
