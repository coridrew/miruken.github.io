Miruken
=======

Miruken is an application framework that embraces composition and convention.  It uses true object-oriented JavaScript and enables powerful aspect-oriented programming to enhance the JavaScript development stack. JavaScript historically does not leverage object-oriented principles. This often results in unnecessary and undesirable coupling and complexity. Miruken leverages inversion of control and the dynamic capabilities of JavaScript to fill this missing layer and amplify the object-oriented capabilites of JavaScript.
